What is it?
---------------

The `WH_Utils` repo is meant to make development easier across the organization by standardizing the way
we interact with common objects. For example, there are modules for `Objects` that contain all enums used
by the organization and a `Models` module that contains a powerful class based representation of common
objects. For more info on this check out the docs.
