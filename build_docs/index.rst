What is it?
---------------

The `WH_Utils` repo is meant to make development easier across the organization by standardizing the way
we interact with common objects. For example, there are modules for `Objects` that contain all enums used
by the organization and a `Models` module that contains a powerful class based representation of common
objects. For more info on this check out the docs. See the overview tab for a more detailed description.

How to install
-------------------

``python -m pip install git+https://github.com/WealtHawk-prod/WH_Utils.git``

I will eventually put this on pypi or something but until then just use this.
